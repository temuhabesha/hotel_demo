 Page Banner/Header (<GalleryBanner />)
What ChatGPT Said: "Title: 'Gallery' or 'Discover Our Space,' Subtitle: 'Step inside LodgeLink and explore our rooms, facilities, and local charm.' Optionally use a blurred hero image or video background."

My Take: Absolutely essential. Just like our RoomsHeroSection, a dedicated banner sets the tone and context immediately.

"Discover Our Space" is a particularly inviting headline, aligning with LodgeLink's warm and welcoming vibe.

Using a blurred hero image or video background would be incredibly effective here. Imagine a soft-focus shot of your beautiful lobby or garden, hinting at the quality within without giving everything away at once. It maintains the sophisticated feel.

2. Filter or Category Tabs (<GalleryFilterTabs />)
What ChatGPT Said: "Helps users browse by image category: All, Rooms, Restaurant, Lobby, Garden, Events / Local Area."

My Take: This is invaluable for user experience. LodgeLink Bahir Dar will likely have a diverse range of photos, and allowing guests to filter them will:

Enhance navigation: Guests can quickly find what they're looking for (e.g., just see restaurant photos if they're interested in dining).

Reduce overwhelm: A large, unfiltered grid can be daunting. Categories provide structure.

Showcase breadth: It implicitly communicates that you have multiple appealing areas (rooms, restaurant, garden, lobby).

3. Responsive Image Grid (<ImageGalleryGrid />)
What ChatGPT Said: "Displays photos in a grid layout: Lightbox or modal when clicked, Hover effect (zoom, overlay), Lazy-loaded images for performance."

My Take: This is the core visual presentation and the suggestions here are spot on.

Responsive grid: Non-negotiable for a modern website, ensuring beautiful display on any device.

Lightbox/modal on click: This maintains the user's flow on the page, consistent with our RoomDetailsModal, providing a seamless viewing experience.

Hover effect (zoom, overlay): A subtle, elegant hover effect (perhaps a slight zoom or a soft overlay with a title) would add a premium feel without being distracting.

Lazy-loaded images: Crucial for performance. Galleries can be heavy, and lazy loading ensures the page loads quickly, improving SEO and user satisfaction, especially for guests with slower internet connections in Bahir Dar.

4. Image Modal (Lightbox View) (<ImageLightbox />)
What ChatGPT Said: "Opens larger view of an image when clicked: Next / Previous buttons, Description or location (optional)."

My Take: A necessary companion to the image grid. It's essentially the same logic as our RoomDetailsModal, but tailored for individual images.

Next/Previous buttons: Allows for quick Browse through the larger images without closing and re-opening the modal.

Description or location: Adding a small caption here (e.g., "LodgeLink Lobby - Evening Ambiance" or "Garden View from Executive Suite") adds context and can be very engaging.

5. Call to Action / Booking Prompt (<GalleryCTA />)
What ChatGPT Said: "After they see your beauty, encourage them to act: 'Ready to stay with us? Let’s book your room today.' Button → WhatsApp or Booking Form."

My Take: Excellent strategic placement. After visually captivating your guests with beautiful imagery, you want to seize that momentum.

Strategic positioning: Placing it at the bottom ensures guests have seen the full visual appeal before being prompted to act.

Clear, action-oriented text: "Ready to stay with us? Let's book your room today" is direct and inviting.

Direct link to WhatsApp or Booking Form: Given LodgeLink's context, providing direct contact options is highly effective for converting interest into bookings.
